Market Risk
All investments carry risk of loss. Stock prices can fluctuate and you may lose principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Diversification does not eliminate risk.

Interest Rate Risk
Bond prices move inversely to interest rates. Rising rates can decrease bond values. Longer-term bonds are more sensitive to rate changes.

Inflation Risk
Inflation can erode purchasing power over time. Fixed-income investments may not keep pace with inflation. Consider growth investments for long-term inflation protection.

Liquidity Risk
Some investments may be difficult to sell quickly. Real estate and certain alternative investments have limited liquidity. CDs have early withdrawal penalties.
